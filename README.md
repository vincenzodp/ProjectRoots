# Plant-a-geddon


Plant-a-Geddon  is a tower-defence like game where the goal is to defend an invader alien tree from the inhabitants of an invaded planet while planting its roots in it, using guns-like plant-towers built upon the tree’s bark. The final aim of the game is to let the roots reach the invaded planet’s core, destroying it. The way towers and roots can be built is through a shared resource, the tree’s Sap, threatened by the planet’s inhabitants that will try to consume it totally coming in waves from both the tree’s side.
